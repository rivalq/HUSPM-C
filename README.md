# HUSPM-C
High Utility Sequential Pattern Mining in C++


### Goal of project
> Research in High Utility Sequential Pattern Mining is in its very early phase, current papers completely omit some of the non trivial parts and even some papers have errors and some of them have modified definations. Our first Goal is to properly define the problem. We are using some of definations from USPAN algorithm. Secondly Provide Algorithms to Solve the HUSPM problem, First we will provide an optimized deterministic algorithm, but main goal is to get some non deterministic algorithm which may not gurantee all the HUSPs but most of it. 


### Implementation
> Our Current goal is to write a model in low level langauge, in our case C++, Then switch to some high level language like julia or python to run machine learning algorithm on top of model written in C++.

### Todo list Part 1
- [x] Implementing model without optimizations
- [ ] Optmizing utility function (bottle neck).
